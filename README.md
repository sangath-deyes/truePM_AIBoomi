# TruePM - AI-Native Product Workspace

## Overview

TruePM is an AI-native product workspace that unifies human and AI teams. It serves as a context hub where product knowledge — from ideas to build tasks — stays connected. This solves the problem of fragmented tools and ungrounded AI outputs, enabling faster, more accurate product development.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional product development tools create silos between ideation, planning, and execution. AI tools often operate in isolation without understanding your product's full context, leading to generic or misaligned outputs. TruePM bridges this gap by maintaining a unified knowledge graph that keeps all product information connected and accessible to both human teams and AI agents.
